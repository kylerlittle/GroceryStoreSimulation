* Description: This program simulates two lines in a grocery store as two	  *
*			   queues. There are Normal & Express "lines." The arrival and	  *
*			   service times for each customer are randomly generated.		  *
*			   enqueues and dequeues are made as necessary. The simulation	  *
*			   runs for 'n' minutes (inputted by user). Various information	  *
*			   is printed out as the simulation runs.						  *
*                                                                             *
* Relevant Formulas: Refer to each function definition.                       *
